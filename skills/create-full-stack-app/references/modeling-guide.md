# Modeling guide

## Start from product meaning

Identify the durable nouns, stored facts, relationships, rules, and user-visible workflows in the product. Do not
begin by transcribing database tables or Rails macros.

Use these distinctions:

- **Entity:** a durable domain record type with its own records and lifecycle.
- **Field:** a semantic value owned by one Entity. One Field may lower to several target implementation elements.
- **Reference:** a stored relationship fact owned by the referencing Entity.
- **Association:** a named traversal over a Reference or other Associations.
- **Predicate:** a reusable named Boolean definition.
- **Validation:** a structured invariant whose error belongs to a Field, Reference, or Entity.
- **Scaffold:** the standard generated routes and surfaces explicitly requested for one Entity.

Ask whether a concept needs independent records, merely describes another record, or is derivable. Prefer the
smallest structured meaning that preserves the user's product intent.

## Model Entities and Fields

For each Entity:

1. Choose a stable lower-snake-case `key` and a human-facing singular `name`.
2. Select a typed `primary_descriptor` that can identify a record to a person.
3. Add only Fields that represent stored or continuously derived product facts.
4. Choose a semantic Field `type`, not a target column type.
5. Decide requiredness, immutability, default, normalization, and structured validations independently.

Do not infer uniqueness from a label, presence from a form, or immutability from current UI. Ask when those facts
matter.

## Model relationships

Put a Reference on the Entity that stores the relationship fact. Ask:

- Which Entity types may be targeted?
- Must every referencing record have a target?
- What should happen to referencing records when a target is deleted?
- Is the target immutable after creation?
- Is the relationship one-to-one?
- For a closed multi-target Reference, which supported target realization should be used?

Do not author the Reference's same-key forward Association. Add a referenced-side Association when the target
needs a meaningful reverse traversal. Add an indirect Association only when the composed traversal itself has a
stable product name or behavior.

## Add behavior deliberately

- Add Predicates and Orderings when generated queries or surfaces need reusable product meaning.
- Add a Scaffold only when the user wants those standard generated routes and surfaces.
- Make access on generated surfaces explicitly public or Policy-controlled.
- Treat every structured definition as a generation request; there is no per-subject opt-out.
- Keep custom Ruby, arbitrary seed code, secrets, and post-Compilation implementation notes outside the Plan.

Do not add a realization choice when the target profile has only one supported lowering. Do not repeat derived
Capabilities or prerequisites as authored lists.

## Preserve intent during diagnostics

Fix the smallest well-founded source problem. Preserve unrelated subjects, ordering, and stable identity. If a
diagnostic reveals an ambiguous product decision, ask the user rather than optimizing for a green response.

In particular, do not remove nonempty modeled content solely because the prototype importer supports only an
empty starter. That is a server capability gap and should remain visible.

## Prepare user review

Summarize choices that materially affect the generated Foundation, including:

- Entity boundaries and primary descriptors;
- required, immutable, or derived values;
- relationship deletion and multiplicity;
- authentication and authorization;
- enabled native or delivery features;
- target realization choices; and
- warnings or unsupported target behavior.

Separate verified diagnostics from modeling assumptions and from unimplemented First Draft capabilities.
