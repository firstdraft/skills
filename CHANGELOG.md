# First Draft changelog

Changes and guidance for people and agents building with First Draft: the Compiler, Skills, tooling, workflows,
and recommended practices. Each entry names its scope and release status. A recommendation does not imply a
software release; compare it with the application and workflow you own today.

## Reviewing updates

Ask your existing agent:

> Review new First Draft changelog entries for this app. Compare them with our current source and workflow,
> apply improvements that fit my request, and record what you reviewed in `.firstdraft/updates.md`.

Use the saved entry link to find unread entries, then consider those entries from oldest to newest. If there is
no checkpoint, or its entry cannot be found, review the entries for applicability. Follow the owner's requested
scope and ordinary app tests for any edits. A changelog review does not authorize deployment.

The checkpoint is optional local context. If `.firstdraft/` is absent, use existing owner notes instead of creating
that directory only for this file. After considering all entries through a point, record its newest entry:

```markdown
Last reviewed: [2026-09-27: Public Plan authoring references](https://github.com/firstdraft/skills/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#2026-09-27-public-plan-authoring-references)
```

**Reviewed means considered, not adopted.** Skipped or irrelevant recommendations are normal. Add a short deferred
note only when useful. The checkpoint is not an application dependency; deleting it can cause a reread.

Entries are newest first. Keep their headings stable. Publish material corrections or changed recommendations as
new entries so readers who advanced their checkpoint see them. Entries explain what changed, why, when it applies,
and any useful small example or verification; they need not reproduce commit logs.

## 2026-09-27: Public Plan authoring references

**Skills — merged source, unreleased 0.7.1 candidate.** The packaged authoring references now route to the existing
public [Field catalog](https://firstdraft.github.io/firstdraft/docs/architecture/design/field-catalog.html#normalization-and-comparison)
and [Rails profile](https://firstdraft.github.io/firstdraft/docs/architecture/targets/rails/profile.html), and include
the required native identity and AASM caveats. Dated qualification receipts moved to maintainer history.

This removes the need for private Service access during Plan authoring. If you are revising a Plan, use these
references and the matching analysis for its actual support boundaries. Existing application code needs no change
from this documentation repair. Source integration alone does not make the candidate available from the catalog.

## 2026-09-27: Continue UI work from the application's guidance

**Workflow recommendation.** For ordinary UI work in an existing app, start with its `UI.md`, comparable screens,
and shared components. Keep the app's chosen stack unless the task calls for a migration. This keeps additions
consistent with the application as it has evolved.

`create-full-stack-app` serves Plan authoring and Compilation; the current package contains no additional UI Skill.
An ordinary screen or form edit can proceed in application source using its own guidance. For example, extend a
matching existing form and run its relevant checks instead of starting another Compilation for the UI change.

## 2026-09-27: Use a separate staging credential

**Tooling — released CLI 0.7.0 and Skills 0.7.0.** New remote work defaults to `https://firstdraft.com`. Requested
staging work uses `firstdraft --staging ...` and `FIRSTDRAFT_STAGING_API_TOKEN`; production uses
`FIRSTDRAFT_API_TOKEN`. Resumed Plans keep their saved origin, and staging never falls back to the production token.

This separates credentials for the two services. If an older staging workspace reports missing authentication,
configure its staging credential through the existing setup and resume the requested operation; preserve its
Plan and private CLI state. Continue using a project credential wrapper when one exists. See the
[0.7.0 environment guidance](https://github.com/firstdraft/skills/blob/claude-v0.7.0/skills/create-full-stack-app/references/diagnostics-and-recovery.md#local-state-and-credentials).
This affects First Draft authoring commands, not the generated application's own credentials or runtime.
